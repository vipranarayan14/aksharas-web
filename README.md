# Aksharas

[**Aksharas**](https://aksharas.vipran.in/) is a utility web app for analysing the *akṣaras* and *varṇas* in a Devanagari text.

Many of the existing character counters are designed for English (Latin script) and do not support Devanagari. Even if they do, they only give the number of Unicode characters in the text. But people who read Devanagari count in terms of *akṣaras* (syllables) and *varṇas* (consonants and vowels). This tool helps those who read/type in the Devanagari script by providing information on the *akṣaras* and *varṇas* in their text. It also helps them easily identify typing errors such as extra vowel marks (काी) or colon (:) in the place of *visarga* by providing them with details on invalid and non-Devanagari characters.


The core functionalities are available as a [library on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vipran/aksharas).
